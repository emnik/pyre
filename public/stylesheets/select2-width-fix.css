/*The following is a work around of a bug(?) in a select2 css. If I don't set a max-width value
then in chrome and alike browsers (not in mozilla) in responsive mode the select2 input 
creates a longer width (overflow) than all other elements in the page and the horizontal scrollbar is 
shown...

.select2-hidden-accessible {
	max-width: 100px;
}
